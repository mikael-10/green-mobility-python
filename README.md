# Green Mobility – Data Science Project

🚀 **Exploratory Analysis of Sustainable Transport in Italy**  
This data science project analyzes survey data on transportation habits and sustainability awareness in Italy.  
The goal is to extract insights into green mobility preferences and highlight potential improvements.

---

🧾 **Description**  
This project uses Python and visualization libraries to explore responses from a structured questionnaire about:  
- Most used transport methods  
- Gender and age influence on mobility  
- Willingness to switch to greener alternatives  
- Awareness of pollution and bicycle advantages/disadvantages

The results were obtained by combining descriptive statistics with visual storytelling using bar charts, heatmaps, and frequency tables.

🔧 **Technologies Used**  
- Python 3  
- pandas  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook

---

📊 **Main Visuals**  
- Bar plots of gender and transport method distributions  
- Crosstabs and heatmaps of transport vs. gender  
- Percentage-based insights on greener mobility options

---

🧠 **Key Insights**  
- 🚲 63% of respondents are willing to switch to greener transport.  
- 👩 Women use public transport nearly twice as often as men.  
- 📊 Dataset: 300+ survey responses collected and cleaned in CSV format.

---

💡 **Recommendations**  
- Encourage public transport use among male commuters with awareness campaigns.  
- Expand cycling infrastructure, especially around universities and student zones.  
- Offer subsidies or discounts for public transit passes and electric bike purchases.  
- Integrate environmental education into student programs to boost eco-awareness.
