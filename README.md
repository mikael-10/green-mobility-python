🧾 **Description**  
This project uses Python and visualization libraries to explore responses from a structured questionnaire about:  
- Most used transport methods  
- Gender and age influence on mobility  
- Willingness to switch to greener alternatives  
- Awareness of pollution and bicycle advantages/disadvantages

The results were obtained by combining descriptive statistics with visual storytelling using bar charts, heatmaps, and frequency tables.
